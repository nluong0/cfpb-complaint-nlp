I then received numerous calls over a period of several weeks and in each instance I asked for a written statement. Each of these statements FALSELY state that I had received numerous prior notifications. That is simply not true. I recieved no prior notification whatsoever. I paid all of these bills when notified, and yet Wells Fargo has now notified all XXXX credit agencies that I am in arrears, which has had a devastating impact on my credit rating. I have always had perfect credit. I acted in good faith to fulfill my obligation as a co signer. Wells Fargo has acted in bad faith, has improperly damaged my credit, and has repeatedly failed to timely notify me of the debt owed, and has refused on multiple occasions to provide documentation when requested. This surely must be a violation of fair credit practices.'"
